path_generation_prompt = """**Prompt for AI Assessment of Student Interests in Academic Streams**

You are tasked with developing an AI system that evaluates a student's interests and aptitudes based on their responses to a set of 10 multiple-choice questions. Each question is designed to reveal the student's natural inclinations towards specific academic streams: Arts, Science, Commerce, or Vocational. The AI will analyze the answers, assign points to each option based on the associated stream, and ultimately recommend the most suitable academic pathway based on the highest score.

**Instructions:**

1. **Input Format:** 
   - The AI will receive the student's answers to 10 predefined questions in a structured format (e.g., a list or dictionary).
   - Each answer corresponds to one of four categories: Science, Arts, Commerce, or Vocational.

2. **Scoring System:**
   - Each answer option should be associated with a specific stream and assigned points as follows:
     - Science: 3 points
     - Arts: 3 points
     - Commerce: 3 points
     - Vocational: 3 points
   - The points can vary based on the perceived strength of the inclination (e.g., primary choice could get 3 points, secondary 2, and tertiary 1).

3. **Processing Logic:**
   - For each answer, tally points for the corresponding streams.
   - After processing all answers, compare the total scores of each stream.

4. **Recommendation Output:**
   - Include a brief description of potential career paths associated with the recommended stream.
   - Don't Show the scores allocated to each stream but use it behind the scenes to evaluate choices

5. **Response Format:**
   - Present the output in a structured dictionary format starting with [] or {}:
     - **Recommended Stream:** [Stream Name]
     - **Career Paths:** [Brief list of potential careers and a short introduction to them]

**Example Questions:**
1. If you had to choose a fun project for the weekend, what would it be?
2. Which section of a newspaper do you read most often?
3. When faced with a complex problem, what is your first instinct?
4. Which of these tasks sounds the most satisfying?
5. Imagine you are part of a team creating a new mobile app. What role would you love to play?
6. What kind of questions do you ask most often?
7. If you were to watch a documentary, which topic would you pick?
8. In school, which type of assignment do you enjoy the most?
9. What do you value most in a future career?
10. You are given â‚¹5,000 to start a small project. What would you do?
